# Compatibility

This document covers OpenWrt version support, firewall backend feature parity, required packages, and known limitations.

## OpenWrt Version Matrix

| OpenWrt Version | Release Date | Firewall | Backend | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 23.05.x         | Oct 2023    | fw4      | nftables | Fully supported (primary target) |
| 22.03.x         | Sep 2022    | fw4      | nftables | Fully supported |
| 21.02.x         | Sep 2021    | fw3      | iptables | Supported (auto-detected) |
| 19.07.x         | Jan 2020    | fw3      | iptables | Not tested, may work |
| Snapshots        | Rolling     | fw4      | nftables | Supported |

### Key Differences by Version

| Feature | 21.02 (fw3) | 22.03+ (fw4) |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Network device config | `option ifname` | `option device` |
| Rate limiting | iptables hashlimit | nftables limit rate |
| Internet blocking | iptables FORWARD | nft inet fw4 forward |
| WAN detection | `network.wan.ifname` | `network.wan.device` |
| Flowtable flush on block | N/A | `nft flush flowtable inet fw4 ft` |
| Conntrack kill on block | Yes | Yes |

---

## Architecture Support

The package contains no compiled code (all shell scripts and JavaScript), so it runs on every architecture OpenWrt supports:

| Architecture | Tested | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| aarch64 (ARM64) | Yes | Most modern routers |
| arm_cortex-a7 | Yes | Common mid-range routers |
| mipsel_24kc | Yes | MediaTek MT7621 (common) |
| mips_24kc | Yes | Qualcomm Atheros |
| x86_64 | Yes | VM/PC-based routers |
| i386 | Not tested | Should work |
| riscv64 | Not tested | Should work |

---

## Required Packages

### Core (always required)

| Package | Purpose | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| `conntrack` | Connection tracking CLI (`conntrack -L`) | ~15 KB |
| `luci-base` | LuCI framework (provides `view`, `fs`, rpcd) | (part of LuCI) |

### For Traffic Shaping (optional)

| Package | Purpose | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| `tc-full` | Traffic control utility | ~180 KB |
| `kmod-sched-core` | Kernel scheduler framework | ~20 KB |
| `kmod-sched-htb` | HTB qdisc kernel module | ~15 KB |

If `tc` is not installed, the shaping feature gracefully degrades: the UI still works but shaper actions return an error message explaining what to install.

### For Reverse DNS (optional)

| Package | Purpose | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| `bind-dig` | DNS reverse lookup tool | ~200 KB |

Without `bind-dig`, reverse DNS lookups silently return empty hostnames.

### For Interface Detection (optional)

| Package | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `iw-full` | WiFi station dump, channel info | Shows WiFi band per device |

### For JSON Processing

| Package | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `jsonfilter` | JSON parsing in hotplug | Part of OpenWrt base system |

## nftables vs iptables Feature Parity

| Feature | nftables (fw4) | iptables (fw3) | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Internet blocking | Full | Full | |
| Block packet counters | Yes (nft counter) | Limited | iptables counters reset on rule changes |
| Rate limiting (policer) | `limit rate over N kbytes/s` | `hashlimit` module | Slightly different semantics |
| Rate limit drop counters | Yes (nft counter) | Not easily accessible | |
| Traffic shaping (tc/HTB) | Full | Full | tc is firewall-independent |
| WiFi MAC filtering | Full | Full | Uses uci/hostapd, not firewall |
| Conntrack queries | Full | Full | Same `conntrack` binary |
| Flowtable bypass | `nft flush flowtable` on block | N/A | Ensures block takes effect immediately |

### Behavioral Differences

**Rate Limiting Semantics:**
- nftables: Uses `limit rate over X kbytes/second` on the netdev ingress hook. Operates at the packet level before routing.
- iptables: Uses `-m hashlimit --hashlimit-above Xkbit/sec` in the mangle FORWARD chain. Operates post-routing.

In practice, both achieve the same result (excess packets are dropped), but the measurement granularity differs slightly. nftables tends to be more accurate for bursty traffic.

**Block Rule Placement:**
- nftables: Rule inserted before the `ct state vmap` rule in `inet fw4 forward`, ensuring it catches traffic before connection tracking shortcuts it.
- iptables: Rule inserted at position 1 in the FORWARD chain (`iptables -I FORWARD`).

## Known Limitations

### General

1. **IPv4 only** -- The current implementation only handles IPv4 addresses. IPv6 connections are not tracked, blocked, or shaped.

2. **Single LAN subnet assumption** -- The shaping class ID encoding (`third_octet * 256 + fourth_octet`) assumes all devices are on 192.168.x.x. Non-standard subnets (10.x.x.x) will work for blocking and limiting but may have class ID collisions if multiple /24s are used.

3. **DHCP lease dependency** -- Device names and MACs are resolved from `/tmp/dhcp.leases`. Devices with static IPs that bypass DHCP will show as IP addresses only.

4. **No upload shaping** -- tc/HTB is applied on br-lan egress (which is device download). Upload shaping would require an additional qdisc on the WAN interface, which is not implemented.

5. **Rate limiter precision** -- nftables rate limiting uses kbytes/second granularity. For rates below 8 kbit/s, the minimum effective limit is 1 kbyte/s (8 kbit/s).

### OpenWrt 21.02 Specific

6. **No flowtable flush** -- When blocking a device on fw3, existing established connections may continue until they time out naturally. On fw4, the flowtable is flushed to force immediate enforcement.

7. **No drop counters for rate limiter** -- The `trafficctl-ratelimit-stats.sh` script parses nft output. On iptables, drop counters are not exposed in the same format, so the "Dropped" column will always show "--".

### Traffic Shaping

8. **tc-full required** -- The `tc` binary from the `tc-full` package is required. The minimal `tc` from `iproute2` may lack HTB support.

9. **Bridge-only** -- Shaping assumes the LAN is bridged (`br-lan`). Routed LAN setups without a bridge will not work with the shaper.

10. **No per-interface shaping** -- All shaping happens on the single bridge device. Per-interface (e.g., per-SSID) shaping is not supported.

### WiFi MAC Filtering

11. **Requires deny mode** -- The package sets `macfilter=deny` on all wifi-iface sections. If you are using `macfilter=allow` (whitelist mode), this will conflict.

12. **WiFi deauth** -- MAC filter changes are applied via `hostapd_cli deny_acl` + `deauthenticate`. Only the target client is disconnected; other clients are unaffected. Disconnection is near-instant (no wifi reload).

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist when testing on a new OpenWrt version or backend:

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Package installs without errors
- [ ] LuCI menu entry appears under Status
- [ ] Dashboard loads and shows active devices
- [ ] Device names resolve from DHCP leases
- [ ] Connection count matches `conntrack -L -s <IP> | wc -l`
- [ ] Auto-refresh works at all intervals (5s, 10s, 30s, 60s)

### Internet Blocking

- [ ] Block a device: traffic stops immediately
- [ ] Block counter increments in stats
- [ ] Unblock a device: traffic resumes
- [ ] Block status persists across page refreshes (not reboots)

### Rate Limiting (Policer)

- [ ] Apply rate limit: speed test shows throttled speed
- [ ] Remove rate limit: full speed restores
- [ ] Drop counter increments while limited
- [ ] Multiple devices can be limited simultaneously

### Traffic Shaping (Queue)

- [ ] tc-full installed check works
- [ ] Apply shaper: speed test shows shaped speed
- [ ] Backlog counter shows queued bytes under load
- [ ] Remove shaper: full speed restores
- [ ] Reboot router: shaper re-applies from shapes.json
- [ ] Multiple devices can be shaped simultaneously

### WiFi MAC Filtering

- [ ] Block device from WiFi: device disconnects
- [ ] Unblock device: device can reconnect
- [ ] Works on all radio interfaces (2.4 + 5 GHz)
- [ ] `uci show wireless` confirms maclist changes

### Live Counters (Dashboard)

- [ ] Download speed updates every 2 seconds
- [ ] Speed shows activity during file transfer
- [ ] Drop counters update every 5 seconds
- [ ] Backlog counters update every 5 seconds
- [ ] Counters stop updating when tab is hidden

### Reverse DNS

- [ ] Enable rDNS checkbox: hostnames resolve
- [ ] Non-resolvable IPs show "--"
- [ ] Private IPs are not looked up

### Backend Detection

- [ ] On 22.03+: verify nftables path is used (`nft list table netdev tm_ratelimit`)
- [ ] On 21.02: verify iptables path is used (`iptables -t mangle -L`)
